Initializing the Repository:
The method createRepository is the method that initializes the repository, "Git". It starts by checking whether all the files and directories necessary are present. If they are, it lets the user know they all exist. If they aren't, it creates the missing files or directories. The files and directories present are:

git: the main directory
objects: a directory in git
HEAD: A file in git
index: A file in git

No difficulties with this part
